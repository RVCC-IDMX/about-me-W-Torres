        <h1> Cascading Style Sheets: Hover States </h1>
        
        <article id="lit">

            <div>
                <p>For those experienced with coding in CSS or Cascading Style Sheets, programmers can insert various
                    types of hover effects into their CSS stylesheets to allow for more in-depth personalization of any
                    inert text in a website and improves general engagement for users of a website. These types of
                    effects include, but are not limited to, changing the colors of the targeted text blocks and
                    characters as well as modifying the font size of the text itself. There is a lot of potential in
                    utilizing CSS hover effects for everyone, but it is important to know how to properly implement it
                    in a user's stylesheet(s).</p>

                <p>The first step in setting up an image hover effect within an HTML document is to identify which
                    element you want to apply these effects to using CSS selectors such as “p” for individual paragraph
                    elements in a document or a unique element such as “.wire” which would target an element under the
                    specified class.</p>

                <p>Next, a user should determine the CSS styles you want to implement for the chosen elements.
                    Applicable style selectors include borders, border colors, font size, text and background colors,
                    and other additional style settings. It is up to the user to determine the style setting combination
                    for their elements in order to reach their desired effects.
                </p>

                <p>Finally, in order to set the style changes to appear when the cursor is hovering over the selected
                    elements, you will need to insert a “:hover” pseudo-class in your CSS stylesheet. Doing so will tell
                    the code to only apply the style effects requested whenever a computer’s cursor is set on top of the
                    targeted element. The size of the element is also taken into account when determining the area being
                    affected by the hover state pseudo-element.
                </p>

                <p>Some ideal uses for effectively inserting hover states include highlighting crucial navigation links,
                    giving text and other content unique personalities, and drawing attention to images included in
                    websites. It is important to know the best possible way to effectively style your hover states in
                    these scenarios so that the content affected is still viewable to its readers and viewers.
                </p>

                <p> There are a variety of effects you can create that aren’t just related to modifying colors and sizes
                    of elements. One of the effects you can do include creating a bouncing effect within the website.
                    This type of effect utilizes “animation” properties to determine the length, delay, and number of
                    iterations of the desired effect or if the effect is looped infinitely.
                </p>

                <p>When implemented properly, the CSS hover states can breathe fresh life into a person’s website and
                    keep users engaged as they browse through the site’s contents. There are a ton more effects that can
                    be created which could be of use to a person’s development for their own sites, so I encourage you
                    to experiment with the many properties you can implement in CSS to see what type of effects you can
                    create.</p>
