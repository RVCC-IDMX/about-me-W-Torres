## Project Description (About Me)

The general purpose of the About Me project is to gradually design a website that describes me as an individual throughout the course of a semester. This website would also be improved with additional coding techniques to make the information and content found on the site look nicer and be more accessible to read for mobile users or visually impaired individuals.
